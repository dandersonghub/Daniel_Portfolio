Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I am passionate about innovation and leveraging data analytics, data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and data visualizations to help businesses make informed decisions. Below are summaries of a few projects that I have recently completed. Click project links to view full details.

# [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Linear Regression](https://github.com/dandersonghub/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
This project demonstrates the process of using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean a dataset, understand the variables, and analyze the relationships between variables using simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. A survey dataset of population health-related data was explored in this project and a simple and multiple linear regressions were modeled to determine the main features that predict systolic blood pressure (BP).

Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to review and compared the relationships between the target and 7 potential predictor variables. The variable 'AGE' was determined to be a statistically significant predictor of blood pressure with a moderate correlation of 0.46 and a p-value <0.001. Ninteen percent of the variation in systolic BP is explained by age. Variables for age, smoking status, and, BMI were modeled to explain the variation in blood pressure. After controlling for BMI, the age and smoking status effects on blood pressure decreased. Twenty percent of the variation in BP can be explained by age, smoking status, and, BMI.

# [Project 2: Data Visualization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dandersonghub/Data-Visualization/blob/main/Data_Visualization.ipynb)
This project utilizes Python to generate data visualizations on data extracted from the web. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to visualize trends, and patterns in data. The datasets explored in this project included immigration data from the United Nation's website and vacation rental data from the city of New Orleans' website. This project outlines the use of the following visualizations to explore data trends and insights, line plots, area plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, bubble plots and maps.
