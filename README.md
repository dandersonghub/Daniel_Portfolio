# Daniel Anderson's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I am passionate about innovation and leveraging data analytics, data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and data visualizations to help businesses make informed decisions. Below are summaries of a few projects that I have recently completed. Click project links to view full details.

# [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/dandersonghub/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/EDA.ipynb)
This project demonstrates the process of using EDA to clean a dataset, understand the variables, and analyze the relationships between variables. EDA is an important step in the data analysis process where several techniques are utilized to better understand the dataset being used. A survey dataset of population health-related data was used. The objective of this project was to explore the dataset to determine the main features that have the most impact on blood pressure 'BP'.

Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to review and compared the relationships between the target and 7 potential predictor variables. The variable 'AGE' was determined to be the only statistically significant predictor of blood pressure with a moderate correlation of 0.46 and a p-value <0.001. Based on this analysis, the variable 'AGE' has been shown to significantly affect our target variable 'BP' and should be considered when performing predictive modeling.

# [Project 2: Data Visualization](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dandersonghub/Data-Visualization/blob/main/Data_Visualization.ipynb)
This project utilizes Python to generate data visualizations on data extracted from the web. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to visualize trends, and patterns in data. The datasets explored in this project included immigration data from the United Nation's website and vacation rental data from the city of New Orleans' website. This project outlines the use of the following visualizations to explore data trends and insights, line plots, area plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, bubble plots and maps.
